# Design Patterns SMDS
- [Software Design Patterns](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-design-patterns/) are used to represent some of the best practices adapted by experienced object-oriented software developers. A design pattern systematically names, motivates, and explains a general design that addresses a recurring design problem in object-oriented systems.  It describes the problem, the solution, when to apply the solution, and its consequences. It also gives implementation hints and examples.
